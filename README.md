# fix_chrome_redirect_virus

### Problem description
Open a new tab on Google Chrome, enter search content on the URL text field, and press enter. I could occasionally see that Google search result shows up but it was always automatically redirected to either Yahoo or Bing. It annoys me so much. And as a man playing with circuits and codes, I decided to fix it.

#### Enter search content

#### Redirected to Bing
![redirected to bing](/images/redirected_to_bing.png)
#### Redirected to Yahoo
![redirected to bing](/images/redirected_to_yahoo.png)

### What did not fix it

#### 1. Did not find unwanted application in ~/Application (I am using a Mac).
#### 2. Chrome `settings >> Restore settings to their original defaults` did not fix it.
